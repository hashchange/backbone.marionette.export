Lo-dash underscore build, with added deepClone support.

Generated with `lodash underscore plus=clone,cloneDeep`.

The regular Underscore build of Lo-dash does not include `cloneDeep`. For Backbone projects, it can be added in a custom build, though. When building with the command above, Underscore compatibility is still preserved.

See https://github.com/bestiejs/lodash/issues/206 for a discussion of the topic.
